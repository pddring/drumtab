# drumtab
Play and practice alongside drum tab

## Aim:
I'd like to be able to quickly write out (or copy) some drum tabs such as the following

```
  HH|x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-||
   S|----o-------o---||
   B|o-------o-------||
     1 + 2 + 3 + 4 +
```

I'd like a web based solution that will: 
- parse the tab and display it on a musical stave
- play the beat using web midi (sending drums to external drum kit or synth)
- let you change the speed of playback (starting slow and automatically increasing as you practice)
- detect notes that you play on an e drum kit and give a visual indication / score based on how closely what you play matches the beat

## Getting involved:
I'm just starting out. Watch this space and do get involved if you'd like to contribute.
